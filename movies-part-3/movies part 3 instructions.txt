

For this final part of our Movie Database in this unit, we are going to add a search feature to the menu.

Once the user selects to search, you should call the search function that prompts the user for a field to search. If they search for an Actor or Title, then prompt them for a string to search for. If they choose to search for a year or rating, prompt them for a range (i.e. starting and ending year or min and max rating).

Your search menu should take a numeric option and you should catch any invalid characters and separately catch any value that is not in the range. (See sample output). As a challenge, see if you can also catch invalid entries for the year and rating search.

Once you have a valid search criteria, use the list function you created earlier to print out the results.
